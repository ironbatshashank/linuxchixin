<h3 id="aim-of-linuxchix-india">Aim of Linuxchix India</h3>

<p>We value the participation of each member of the LinuxChix India community. For this reason, we hope that in all the media and events of LinuxChix India we show respect and courtesy towards others.</p>

<p>To leave no doubt, what is expected is to comply with the following Code of Conduct. The coordinators will be responsible for promoting compliance with this code:</p>

<h3 id="the-code">The Code</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each member has the right to be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect and to be free from any form of discrimination, victimization, harassment or intimidation; as well as to enjoy an environment free of unwanted behavior, inappropriate language and inappropriate images.<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Harassment is strictly prohibited</strong> . Understanding by this to the offensive communication related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking following of photographic harassment or recording, sustained interruption of conversations or other events, inappropriate physical contact and unwanted sexual attention. We also consider as harassment the offensive communication related to the preference of text editor, the choice of operating system and fanaticism to a programming language.<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be kind to others</strong> : We trust that members will be able to treat others in a way that reflects the widespread belief that diversity and respect are the strengths of our community that are celebrated and fostered.<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be careful with the words you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusion jokes can be offensive to those around you.<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid discussing topics related to religion and / or politics. Our community focuses on the discussion of issues related to technology. We believe that discussing issues that may lead to division does not contribute to the mission and vision we have as a community.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The coordinators will be there to help each member feel safe and free of harassment, so if problems arise covered by this code of conduct, please contact the LinuxChix India coordinators through one of our contact means . Any complaint will be confidential, will be taken seriously, investigated and treated appropriately.</p>

<p>If a member engages in behavior that violates the code of conduct, the coordinators can take whatever action they deem appropriate, including from warnings to expulsion from the <a href="https://mailman.linuxchix.org/mailman/listinfo/indichix">IRC channel</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxchix.org/content/irc-chat">Mailing list</a> and <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/BzYbR0NlHezSUou42Q78JQ">Telegram</a></p>
